Generating reference sorted list using Python's "sorted" built-in function for validating correctness of serial version and parallel version of quicksort... Done!

Time to sort list of 1000000 integers...

...using serial version of quicksort: 1.768480 seconds.

Validating result of serial version of quicksort...
    Congratulations, expected and actual lists are equal!

Validating result of parallel version of quicksort...
    Congratulations, expected and actual lists are equal!
