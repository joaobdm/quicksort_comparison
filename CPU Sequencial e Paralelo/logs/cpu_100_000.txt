Initializing list copies to be sorted (this may take some time)...

Generating reference sorted list using Python's "sorted" built-in function for validating correctness of serial version and parallel version of quicksort... Done!

Time to sort list of 100000 integers...

...using serial version of quicksort: 0.127313 seconds.

...using parallel version of quicksort (parallelized over a target of 16 processes): 0.105330 seconds.

Validating result of serial version of quicksort...
    Congratulations, expected and actual lists are equal!

Validating result of parallel version of quicksort...
    Congratulations, expected and actual lists are equal!
